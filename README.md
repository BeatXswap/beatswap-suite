# BeatSwap – On-Chain RWAfi Protocol for Music Copyright

BeatSwap is a Web3-native protocol that tokenizes, manages, and trades music copyrights as on-chain Real-World Assets (RWAs).  
It enables artists, fans, and investors to become aligned stakeholders through transparent and decentralized infrastructure.

---

## Project Vision

Web2 platforms suffer from opaque royalty structures and centralized control. BeatSwap's mission is to move beyond merely converting Web2 revenues to Web3. Instead, we aim to generate, track, and distribute revenue natively within the Web3 ecosystem—from the inception of each music asset.

---

## Key Features

### Copyright RWA Oracle
- Stores verifiable music copyright metadata on-chain.
- Enables external streaming platforms and services to query metadata securely and transparently.

### Space (Decentralized Fan Community)
- Artists bind existing social media accounts or post directly within the platform.
- Fans follow, comment, and like to earn rewards via "Shout & Earn."
- Encourages direct artist-fan communication and active community participation.

### RWA Launcher
- Allows musicians and rights holders to tokenize copyrights and initiate public sales.
- Ensures transparent royalty distribution from the outset.

### Copyright DEX
- Facilitates secure and transparent on-chain trading of copyright tokens.
- Provides global and permissionless access to music-backed assets.

---

## Architecture Overview

- Canister smart contracts for immutable and decentralized metadata storage.
- Web2-to-Web3 metadata migration pipeline converts legacy CMS/label data into verifiable on-chain records.
- External streaming services perform direct metadata queries via Canister OUTCALLs.
- Future integrations include AI-driven music recommendations based on Canister-stored behavior data.

---

## Milestone-Based Deliverables

### Month 1 – Planning & Architecture
- System architecture specification (Canister, dashboard, external integration)
- Web2-to-Web3 metadata mapping strategy
- UI/UX wireframes for Dashboard, Space, and Launcher

### Month 2 – Core Development & Migration
- Canister implementation for storing metadata and managing RWA registrations
- Dashboard prototype displaying real-time track information
- Web2 metadata migration script (validated with sample datasets)

### Month 3 – Integration, Testing & Launch
- Fully integrated demo (Dashboard ↔ Canister ↔ Streaming Partners)
- Public deployment of BeatSwap v1
- Final technical report summarizing architecture, logic, and implementation

---

## Global Reach & Impact

BeatSwap leverages the global expansion of K-POP and digital music culture, addressing a market of over 2 billion music fans worldwide.

- Artists: Increased earnings lead to greater creativity and content production.
